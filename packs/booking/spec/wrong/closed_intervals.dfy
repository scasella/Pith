// Known-wrong core: treats intervals as closed [s, e], so a booking that starts exactly when another ends is
// refused. Safe (no overlap is ever accepted) but violates [B2]: touching endpoints are free under the contract.
// With a buffer g it is the buffer read as "more than g minutes apart": a booking exactly g away is refused (T12).
